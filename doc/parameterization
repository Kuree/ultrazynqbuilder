# Overview
There are a number of files in the build process which must be parameterized based on what is being built:

- Hardware creation script
- Driver files

The basic mechanism for this is the [Mako template engine](http://makotemplates.org) with a parameter configuration file.  The `parameterize.py' script reads this config file to generate a key:value map and calls Mako to parameterize the file.

The parameters themselves come from user preferences (e.g., how many parallel cameras to include) and from the hardware accelerators (e.g., number and size of data streams).
The former are specified with the `hwconfig.user` file.  An example of such a file is in the repository as `hwconfig.example`.  Accelerator-specific parameters are extracted with `extractparams.py`, which reads the user configuration file and fills in parameters for all of the specified accelerators.  This produces a complete parameters file, `hwconfig.all`, which can then be used repeatedly by `parameterize.py'.
